// PostToolUse hook. Measures AGENTS.md against this repo's word limits and
// reports when it is over. Thresholds come from argv, because the repos do not
// agree on them:
//
//   --warn N      the prune line. Required.
//   --ceiling N   the hard limit. Optional - omit it in a repo that states only
//                 a soft ceiling, and the hook reports without claiming a limit
//                 the project never set.
//
// Why this exists: the limit was prose in five repos and enforced in none.
// This repo reached 3,447 words against an 1,850 ceiling - 48% of it one
// section. A rule nobody measures is not a rule.
//
// Why .mjs and not .sh: hooks run on Kevin's Windows machines too, where a bash
// script needs git-bash on PATH and `python3` may be `python`. `node` is the
// same command everywhere and this repo cannot be worked on without it.
//
// PostToolUse cannot block - the write already happened - so this reports and
// pruning stays the session's job.
//
// Counting: whitespace-separated tokens, which agrees with awk, node, python,
// and with `wc -w` on any UTF-8 machine. `wc -w` with no locale set silently
// drops standalone em dashes, so a container can report ~2% low on prose that
// uses them. If this number ever looks wrong, check `locale` before the hook.
